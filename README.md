# Python-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
The objective of the rock-paper-scissor python project is to build a game for a single player that plays with a computer, anywhere, and anytime.
A player who chooses rock will win by another player who chooses scissors but loose by the player who chooses paper; a player with paper will loose by the player with the scissors.
If both players choose the same then the game is tied.
